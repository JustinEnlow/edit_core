always ensure:
    full doctests or unit tests for each item before moving on to the next
    make movements/edits that result in the same state return an error. this allows the front end application to decide whether to display a warning message, giving visual feedback



Document:
    [ ] determine what to do when current file tab width is different than desired tab width, if we do anything at all
        - hard tabs shouldn't change anything we do, but soft tabs might
    [ ] handle auto-indent on newline insertion
    [ ] pipe commands to shell and insert result into document
    [ ] figure out how to handle read-only or permission restricted files...
    [ ] add fn to move current line / selected lines up one line
    [ ] add fn to move current line / selected lines down one line

Selection:
    [ ] make sure extend functions do not extend past doc end. this is ok for movement functions because new characters need to be added to the document
    [x] make search operate over selections, returning matched selections in place of the original selection(maybe the search should be in seletion.rs and the selection ordering management should be in document.rs?)
