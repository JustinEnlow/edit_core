type:
    "rust-gdb ./target/debug/deps/edit_core-ee4" then 'tab' to complete the hash
inside gdb
    "break <module-name>::<sub-module-name>::tests::<full-unit-test-name>"
    "run <module-name>::<sub-module-name>::tests::<full-unit-test-name>"
then hit <ctrl-x> then a, to enter tui mode with test source        or type "layout src", apparently
hit <ctrl-l> to repaint screen, if ncurses prints some funky shit in the tui
and <ctrl-p> to redo a command in the history, since the tui source code window hijacks the <up> arrow
